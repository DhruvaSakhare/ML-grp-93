# Remember you can mark a part of the code and press CTRL+Enter or CMD+Enter
# to run that part alone.

# The colon notation is very important in R as it avoids
# loops, which run very slowly in R
# Generating vectors in R is easy when using the colon
# notation.

# Define variable a with numbers in the range from 0 to 6 (inclusive)
a <- 0:6

# Define variable b with numbers in the range from 2 to 17 in steps of 4
b <- seq(from = 2, by = 4, to = 17)

c <- seq(from = 100, by = -1, to = 95)

d <- seq(from = 1.2, by = 0.1, to = 1.9)

e <- pi * seq(from = 0, by = 0.5, to = 2)
